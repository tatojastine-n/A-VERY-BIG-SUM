# A-VERY-BIG-SUM
â€¢	This program calculates the sum of a large array of long integers to handle big values without overflow. It uses utility functions (ltrim, rtrim, split) to parse input: reads array size, then space-separated numbers into a vector<long>. The aVeryBigSum function iterates via range-based for loop, accumulating the sum in a long long variable before returning it as long.
